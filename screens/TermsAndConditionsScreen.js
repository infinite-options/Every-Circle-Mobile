            YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT NEITHER MANIFEST MY SPACE IS TO DISCONTINUE YOUR USE OF THE SITE. MANIFEST MY SPACE, NOR ANY OF ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, SHAREHOLDERS, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, THIRD-PARTY INFORMATION PROVIDERS, MERCHANTS, OR LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY,"MANIFEST MY SPACE PARTIES") SHALL BE LIABLE TO YOU OR THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL AND/OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, (EVEN IF MANIFEST MY SPACE OR THE APPLICABLE MANIFEST MY SPACE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW FOR: {'\n'}
            (A) THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE MANIFEST MY SPACE OFFERINGS AND/OR ANY OTHER CONTENT, INFORMATION, PRODUCTS AND/OR SERVICES OFFERED BY AND THROUGH SAME; {'\n'}
            (B) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY GOODS, DATA, INFORMATION, CONTENT AND/OR ANY OTHER PRODUCTS PURCHASED OR OBTAINED FROM OR THROUGH THE MANIFEST MY SPACE OFFERINGS; {'\n'}(C) THE UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO, OR ALTERATION OF, YOUR ACCOUNT INFORMATION; {'\n'}(D) THE FAILURE TO REALIZE ANY SPECIFIC DIETARY BENEFIT, WEIGHT LOSS OR OTHER HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOME; AND/OR {'\n'}(E) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE MANIFEST MY SPACE OFFERINGS AND/OR ANY OTHER CONTENT, INFORMATION, PRODUCTS AND/OR SERVICES OFFERED BY AND/OR THROUGH SAME. {'\n'}THIS LIMITATION APPLIES TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION, IN THE AGGREGATE INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, MISREPRESENTATION AND ANY AND ALL OTHER TORTS.

            Resolving Disputes — Arbitration
            {'\n'}Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction BY calling our customer service department at 1-925-400-7469. IF Manifest My Space's customer service department is unable to resolve a complaint you may have to your satisfaction (or if Manifest My Space has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.

            {'\n\n'}All disputes or claims that arise under or related to this Agreement (whether in contract, tort or otherwise, whether past, pre-existing, or future, and including statutory, consumer protection, common law, intentional tort, injunctive, and equitable claims) will be resolved either in small claims court or by individual arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). Unless you and Manifest My Space agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Manifest My Space agrees that it will pay a consumer's filing fee FOR the arbitration.

            {'\n\n'}You agree to arbitration on an individual basis. In any dispute,   NEITHER CUSTOMER NOR MANIFEST MY SPACE SHALL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS BY OR AGAINST OTHER CUSTOMERS, OR ARBITRATE OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLAIMS AS A REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS MEMBER, OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced (but in no case shall there be a class arbitration).  

            {'\n\n'}The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law. Any award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on each of the parties, and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. This transaction and the arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA).

            {'\n\n'}Waiver and Severability
            {'\n'}No waiver by Manifest My Space of any of the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Manifest My Space to assert a right or provision under these Terms and Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

            {'\n\n'}If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.

            {'\n\n'}Entire Agreement
            {'\n'}This Agreement and our Privacy Policy constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and Manifest My Space with respect to the Manifest My Space Offerings and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to the Manifest My Space Offerings.
            {'\n\n'}Notice
